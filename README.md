# commerce_invoice
Invoicing module for drupal commerce

## How it works
Commerce invoice creates a new commerce entity called "invoice"

An invoice is somewhat similar to commerce_order

Commerce invoices will generate a unique number following your pattern, and once confirmed they can no longer be modified.
